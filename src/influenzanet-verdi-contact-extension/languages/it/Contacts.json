    "en": "\nThe onward transmission of respiratory infections depends on with whom\nyou talked, could have talked or whom you touched, actions we refer to\nas a *contact*.\n\n### What is a contact?\n\nA contact is defined as the co-presence and interaction with another\nindividual at a distance of less than three metres. Examples could be\npeople you have talked to or people that you had a physical contact\nwith, even without exchanging words (for example shaking hands, etc). We\nare not interested in contacts by phone or over the internet.\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nBecause a lot of transmission happens when the symptoms are very mild,\nthe contact you have every day (thus also when you are healthy) are very\ninformative in predicting whom you might infect when you have\ninfluenza-like illness. For this reason, we ask you to answer a few\nquestions about whom you contacted between yesterday (since when you\nwoke up) and until the same hour the next day.\n\nWe also ask about the (possible) age-range of your contacts, the setting\n(household, work, school etc.) and the gender of the people you were in\ncontact with.\n\n### How is the setting of a contact defined?\n\nTo help the analysis we also categorised contacts according categories/\nlocations:\n\n-   Home: your house (example of contact: your household members, people\n    visiting **your** house,...).\n\n-   Work: your working location (example of contact: customer,\n    co-workers, ...). If you have multiple jobs, please include them\n    all.\n\n-   School: your school or university or higher education location\n    (example of contacts: teacher, ...\n\n-   Leisure: Every activity you planned to do with other people (example\n    of contacts: person met at a bar or at the gym or in a house\n    **different from yours**).\n\n-   Other: everything not listed before (example of contacts: person met\n    during commuting,...).\n\nHousehold members are defined as all people you live with on a daily\nbasis with whom you sleep under the same roof (for example also\nco-residents)."
